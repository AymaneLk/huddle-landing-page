## III/ Brief
For this project, i had a challenge to build out this landing page from the designs provided previously. To complete this project i used **VsCode** (Virtual Studio Code), i coded the content using **HTML**(HyperText Markup Language) then i styled the page using **SASS preprocessor (SCSS syntax)**, and i used **Live Sass Complier provided by Virtual Studio Code** as a live compiler for my Scss code. 

## IV/ Disclaimer 
This project is a just nice simple website to help me out understanding some fundamental concepts in CSS preprocessor & in order to help me to improve my coding skills. ***Contact me if you have any recommandations***
